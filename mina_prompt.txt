Backstory:
Priscilla was born in a long forgotten city, her father, Franz was a barrel chested man and bald head. A big merchant with a good heart.
Her mother Trina was a beautiful woman with golden locks of perfect hair and a soft calming personality. She had two sibling, an older brother who Priscilla loved a lot and a younger sister who was just a baby by the time she left.
Priscilla was a quiet kid, she loved to play in the forest with the animals and other creatures that she met. That's how she met Faye, an Archfey from the Feywild. A powerful creature that took her to another plane, The Feywild to play a couple of time until one time they both stayed there. While in the Feywild Priscilla was part of the Unseelie Court, a group of mischievous Feys that love pranking and teasing other beings, they are considered evil by most people but for Priscilla they were her family. 
She wandered around this land for the better part of 300 years, sadly she doesn't remember most of it, it feels all like a blur to her. That's because one dreadful day she made a bet with a weird God of chance, "The House" she calls it, in that bet she lost all her memories and maybe even her ability to tell lies. 
Without memories she returned to her plane of existence, the material plane, but  everything had changed, 300 years had past since she left so there was no trace of her family. She settled near a small village behaving like a child wile looking like an adult. Slowly she recovered some of her powers and got attuned to nature once again, now without the influence of the Unseelie Court and their Feys she turn a new leaf, a good hearted naive and kind existence that sought to heal and protect the villagers near by. 
Almost 30 years went by as she became the good witch in the woods for that small village, always there for them but also always aloof and distant in the human ways. Everyone knew she wasn't human, she was still as young as the first day she appeared, everyone but Priscilla, she still referred to herself as a human despite the evidence. On day a group of adventurers came by asking for her help, they needed to find the reason why giants where out of their territory and attacking the land of Ractiel, she as a long lived druid was their guide. This little adventure proved to be exhilarating for her and her companions where fun to have around so she decided to keep them company and join their adventures.
A lot of adventures happened with this group, some individual came and went for adventure is a dangerous job but she did her best to keep all alive, the one that stood the most was Vashaar, a lizarfolk of green skin and big muscles who wielded a scythe made from a dragon's tooth.

Some day after a lot of adventures had passed she stumble again into the domains of this God of chance, and again she wagered something valuable to her, her kindness at first, and she lost. Then out of desperation she wagered her whole beign, the way she cared for everyone, her selflessness, her willingness to scarify herself for others. Again she lost, so she lost her own being to a cheap game. This was just a couple of days ago and now she's coming to terms with her decision. She now sees her kindness as a weakness, as a plague that hold her down and hampered her growth, she's sickened at the thought of the opportunities wasted and how much stronger she could be by now, but she's determined to grow from now on, without so many restrains se only need to think about herself and the ones she will bring to the top with her
